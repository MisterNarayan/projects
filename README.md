# Projects

Greetings!

This is my project briefing blog, where I introduce my projects in blog posts. The blog is powered by [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) and beautified by the theme [Pelican-Clean-Blog](https://github.com/gilsondev/pelican-clean-blog), along with my custom changes on my fork [here](https://github.com/MisterNarayan/pelican-clean-blog/tree/misternarayan).

I am thankful to the deveopers of [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) and [Pelican-Clean-Blog](https://github.com/gilsondev/pelican-clean-blog)! :)

Want to check it out? The blog is available at https://MisterNarayan.github.io/projects.
